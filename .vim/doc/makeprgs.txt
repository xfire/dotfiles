*makeprgs*	Plugin for guessing the makeprg to use

If you work on several open source projects, chances are you will come across
Makefile, Ant or SCons based build systems. If you have <F5> mapped to :make

	:nmap <F5> :make<CR>

then it would be nice if the correct build program were used. That is the
purpose of this script. It also maps <F5> as mentioned above.

It checks if the file SConstruct or SConscript is in the current directory and
if so sets the makeprg to scons or scons -u for scripts.

If GNUmakefile, makefile or Makefile are found in the current directory, then
the makeprg value is set to make.

If build.xml is found, then "ant" is the assumed compiler - i.e. 
	:compiler ant
is called.

							*makeprgs-settings*
It is possible to extend the types supported by setting the variable
"makeprgs_make_types". For example, if a file named "Foobuild" is present we
should use the foobld program, then this line would work:

 let makeprgs_make_types={ 'glob': 'Foobuild', 'makeprg': 'foobld' }

Dictionary values used are:

glob    - a list or string - glob pattern for the file to search for.
makeprg - string - the value to set makeprg to
compile - string - the value to set :compile to

The makeprg or compile values can be mixed, to set a compile chain and makeprg
together for a particular file type. The makeprgs_make_types can be set to a
list of dictionaries if several custom makeprgs are required.
